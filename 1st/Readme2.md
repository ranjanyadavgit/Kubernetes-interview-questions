CNI Fundamentals

Overview
This is a theory lab which introduces Kubernetes networking concepts with a focus on the Container Network Interface (CNI) specification and popular plugins like Calico, Flannel, and Cilium.
You will learn about the challenges in Kubernetes networking, including pod communication, service discovery, and traffic routing, and discover how CNI plugins address them. 
Additionally, you will explore the differences between overlay and underlay network models and how Kubernetes networking is implemented efficiently.

Inside this lab



Through hands-on documentation and examples, you will:
